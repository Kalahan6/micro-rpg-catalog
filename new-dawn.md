# New Dawn

When: The year 3000  
Where: The decaying ruins of an American city  
Who: You're a hobo  
What: You have 3 items and a weapon of your "choice" As determined by a d6, only limitation is no money  
How: With a d6 for everything: 1 = astounding success, 6 = you die. Determining items: 1 = exactly what you asked for, 2-4 = crappier versions of what you asked for, 5 = pick something else, 6 = lose that item slot. Roll a 6 while trying to go somewhere: end up at The Bar (a treacherous hive of scum and villainy)  
Goal: Acquire $50 so that you'll be allowed into Mom & Pop's General Store, the only business left in the country, and they don't let just anyone in.  
Why: Fun
