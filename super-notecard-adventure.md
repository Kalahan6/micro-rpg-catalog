> Write three words or abilities that describe your character.  
> When facing a difficult action, roll 2d6 and try to roll 8 or higher to succeed. If you roll doubles, roll another d6 and add it to your roll. If one of your three description words fits the situation, add +2 to your roll. Be sure you describe exactly what your character is trying to do. Combat is handled in a similar way. Roll 2d6 to attack, adding bonuses. If you roll 8 or higher then the defender rolls 2d6, adding their bonuses. If they roll 8 or higher they dodge. If not, one of their description words is stunned for the rest of the combat and can't be used for a bonus. If all of someone's description words get stunned, they're knocked out.
