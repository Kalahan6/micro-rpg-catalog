# Fuggit, let's play

FLP is short for Fuggit, Let's Play. (well, actually, that's the polite version of the name). FLP is designed for those times when a bunch of nerds find themselves bored and want to quickly start up a game.

Each player will need a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. The GM doesn't need any dice, but pen and paper may be handy.

## Character creation

To make a character, each player chooses 4 skills, and assigns the skills values of 6, 8, 10, and 12. The skills can be whatever the players want, however broad or narrow they might want to make it, up the GM's discretion. They should probably try to pick some kind of archetype, though. Or not. Fuggit. Let's play.

Each player sets the d20 in front of them on 20, representing their hit points. It can never go above 20, and if they lose their last HP they die. They take the other 5 dice and set them in their dice pool.

## Skill checks

Whenever a player makes a skill check, he chooses what die he wants to use from his dice pool. The die can be up to the value of the skill. For example, if you've got Attack at 8, you can roll the d4, d6, or d8 when you make an attack. If you need to make a check and you don't have a skill, you always roll the d4.

Roll the chosen die. On a 4 or higher, you're successful. Otherwise, you've failed and something bad happens to you, at the GM's discretion.

After the roll, whatever the results, one of two things will happen.

If you rolled anything other than a d4, remove that die from your pool. You can no longer roll it until you get it back.

If you rolled a d4, refill your dice pool so it contains a d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12 again.

It's important that the GM should only allow you to make rolls if there's a penalty for failure. If there's no penalty for failure, you may automatically succeed.

## Combat

Combat is taken in turns. First each PC acts, in what ever order they want, and then the GM acts for each NPC. Repeat until one side is dead or routed.

You want to attack something? Make an attack roll, or whatever other skill check makes sense. If you're successful, you do 1 point of damage. If the GM thinks you did something entertaining, cool, etc, he might increase the damage to 2 or 3 points.

Instead of attacking, you can also try to heal someone. Make a healing check. On a success, the target heals 2 points of damage. On a failure, the target takes 1 point of damage.

When the GM attacks you, you must make a defense skill check. If you fail the defense skill check, you take damage from the enemy.

## Enemy/Environment Stats

Most enemies and hazards do 1 point of damage. Particularly nasty ones might do 2 or 3.

Most enemies have 5 hit points, but this can vary widely. A powerful dragon might have 60 or more.

## Advancement

If you want to gain experience and level up your characters, play something else.
