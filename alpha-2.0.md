# Alpha 2.0

In this new version of Alpha, i'm trying to fine tune the awesomeness of our first run into something even better. plus magic. and advantage, from d&d 5e. We're using a d6 for rolls and checks. no crits, but extra success is extra cool. like double 6s when you have advantage? you get to describe the outcome as though you were in complete control of the universe(subject to dm approval or modification). who am i kidding, might as well call it a crit. the random hit table uses a d20.

## attributes

spd/str/sta/wil/int/luck. zero is average. +1 adds to appropriate rolls. -1 subtracts from appropriate rolls.

modifiers can only go up to 5, which means automatic success. these basic attributes are very hard to improve, so keep that in mind. these increase with use, and decrease with misuse. start with one +2, one +1, one -2, and one -1. (for example: a new character has -1spd/ +2str/ +1sta/ 0wil/ -2int/ 0luck.)

## traits

choose any three, when they become necessary. hopefully this happens before the first session is over, because i'll choose them for you if you don't. if you want a list of suggestions, i have one made, but i'd prefer it were something we work out together.

(for example: graceful, grants always advantage, and once per day automatic success when something requires a measure of grace. sneaky, grants advantage, and once per day automatic success to approach someone with stealth. intimidating, grants advantage, and once per day influence someone into thinking twice about crossing you.)

## skills

these are learned things, not innate to your character. you'll acquire these on your adventures or by finding a tutor who can teach you about the skill. most require certain prerequisites. i won't let a -2int character learn advanced biochemistry.

(for example: lockpicking, allows the use of tools to open locks. ropeworking, allows the use of ropes in various circumstances to grant bonuses on appropriate rolls. engineering(basic), allows semi-accurate measurements and use of simple machines to gain roll advantages or bonuses.)

## magic

has rules. the use of magic substracts from your base stats temporarily. highest first. amount is proportionate to the power of the spell. every spell is unique, and every caster their own iteration. but generally, the more effective the spell, the more costly. there are fatigue spells, befuddling spells, alteration spells, telekinesis spells, illusory spells, destructive spells, and so on. this is where you decide what you want to happen, and i assess whether your character is ready for that power level, then assign an appropriate cost. as you use the spell repeatedly, the cost will probably drop, or the effect will intensify.

## hit points

10 hp per person. modified by stamina. they can take this much beating before having serious difficulties or long term damage. be aware that there are special circumstances to nullify the use of hit points, like being caught unaware, or smashed by falling rocks. monstrous creatures, or armored foes might have modified hp, 'cause life ain't fair.

## random hit locations

based on a d20 roll. 19-20 head, 18 neck, 12-17 arms, 5-11 torso, 1-4 legs. to be modified for non-humanoids. these have appropriate special effects. you might trip someone by hitting their legs, or daze someone by hitting them in the head. you can aim for a specific spot, but at a penalty for damage, and double the odds of hit.

(for example: "i aim my club at his head." 17-20 is a hit, -2damage. "i aim my chain at his legs as he runs away." 1-8 is a hit, and he'll get a spd check to avoid falling on his face.)

## checks and balances

rolls work like the dc's of d&d, but obviously won't scale tremendously high, since we're sticking to a system without level progression. difficulty of checks range from no-brainer 2s, to holy-crap-that-seems-highly-improbable-but-somehow-managed-to-pull-it-off 6s.

many, if not most, rolls will be contested by NPC's or monsters of the world, who will have appropriate stats for their stations and/or physicalities.

## combat

an attack goes like this. George swings at Martin with a hatchet (light 1 handed). George rolls a d6+str against Martin's d6+spd. if George rolls higher than Martin(ties go to defender), it's a hit. roll damage and location of hit. if thematically appropriate, hits should come with a special effect, like disarming or tripping or stunning or bleeding. also note: no damage usually means no effect.

weapon damages are as follows:

* light 1 hand, d2
* heavy 1 hand, d3
* light 2 hand, d3
* heavy 2 hand, d4

armor for a particular part of the body will reduce damage slightly, but at the cost of spd.
