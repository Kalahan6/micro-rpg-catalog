# Maneki Neko Engine: A Game Design Exercise

## Attributes

* *Yes!*: This is the attribute you use when you're being proactive, exercising agency, and getting things done right now. It's for being a headstrong and probably reckless hero who drives the action forward.
* *Hmm…*: This is the attribute you use when you're being thoughtful, contemplative, reactive, or patient. It's for being intelligent and knowledgeable, and changing the world in long-term ways that might not seem like very much until they're completed.
* *Hah!*: This is the attribute you use when you're scoffing at the attempts of the world to stand in your way. Ninja death squad ambush? Hah! A black adder in your tea? Hah! Creeping remorse over a lifetime of senseless violence? Hah to that too! It's for being an implacable character who's very tough, and resists the best efforts of the narrative to grind him down.
* *Sigh…*: This is the attribute you use when you don't want to. It's for remorseful action that is necessary but unpleasant, or drastic options that are only being taken because it can't be helped. It's for being a hero who isn't happy about being a hero or is scared of the power they wield.
* *^_^*: This is the attribute you use for being a likable character, as portrayed within the fiction of the game. It doesn't actually cover things like social skills or charisma by default—it's about making the players like the character, not the other characters. It's for being a fan favorite who gets all the good lines!
* *???*: This is the attribute you use for being weird, eccentric, or for handling things when they stop making sense—either within the fiction of the game, or within the rules used to represent that fiction. It's a weird ability. It does weird things. It's for characters with a strange view of life who don't seem like they ever really do anything, but really are accomplishing quite a lot through their distinctively quirky personalities.

## Skills

Most mundane actions are resolved using just a basic attribute roll. Skills aren't things like Driving a Car or Computer Hacking or Kendo—they're top of the line supernatural powers, fit for the protagonist of a shounen anime or the hero of an epic saga. Example skills include:

* Legendary Kung Fu
* Witchcraft
* Super Strength
* Just As Planned/Retconned
* Magical Girl
* Spirit Beast Familiar
* Giant Mecha Pilot
* Protagonism as Enforced by Narrative Fiat
* Messiah
* Time Travel
* Monster Hunting

## Action Resolution

Attributes and skills are both rated between 1 and 5 dice. When you roll an attribute, or an attribute + skill, roll the appropriate number of six-sided dice. Every die that comes up a 5 or a 6 is a success. If you're desperate, then you can choose to count 4s as successes after the dice have been rolled, but doing so is considered an explicit invitation to the GM to append some kind of unexpected consequences to your actions.

When a character takes a mundane action, only an attribute is rolled. Kicking down a door is probably going to be a *Yes!* roll, hacking into a computer mainframe will probably be a *Hmm…* roll, and avoiding the mind control aura of a sexy rock and roll incubus because you were too busy stopping to smell the flowers would be a *???* roll.

Magical actions—which really just means "actions that go way beyond the scale of everyday life"—add together an attribute and a skill. Using legendary kung fu to demolish the walls of a fearsome villain fortress is a *Yes!* + *Legendary Kung Fu* roll. Using magic to transform a wicked enemy into a statue is probably *Yes!* + *Witchcraft* or *Sigh…* + *Witchcraft*, but could be *^_^* + *Witchcraft* if the wicked enemy has really had it coming. Using your magical girl transformation stock footage sequence to trigger an extended daydream-like montage where characters interact symbolically is a *???* + *Magical Girl* roll. Magical actions don't automatically trump mundane actions, but because they can potentially roll twice as much dice, they can potentially be a significant advantage.

## Character Creation

Pick one attribute to be your main attribute. Bold it on your character sheet or something. You start off with three dice in that attribute.

Put one die into every other attribute.

Then divide six more dice among your attributes (remember that they don't go higher than five).

Are you a player character, or a very formidable NPC? Pick a skill. Put three dice in it. In theory you could divide these dice up among multiple skills, but that's a sub-optimal choice.

Give your character a name. What's their deal? Do they have a physical appearance? Do they have family? Do they have a social life? What do they want? Why don't they have it? This isn't a game mechanic thing, but it helps!
