# succeed or die

Also I'm working on prettying up and putting out something cool for my game, which is made for waiting for people to arrive to games night, or just silly fun at the pub.

## succeed or die

All you need are some scraps of paper for character sheets.

Each character is a name (a skill if that optional rule is used) and a blank space where you right their death... bonus points if you draw a tombstone around your character sheet.

## to play

Whenever you do something the GM considers a challenge, flip a coin:

* tails *"never fails"* you succeed and you narrate how
* heads *"deads!"* you die, the GM narrates how, in either straight up brutal, or crazy final destination style.

(eg: you are trying to a pick a lock, flip!, heads... you fumble with the lock, your lockpick bending when all of a sudden SNAP! the pick snaps and a piece of the metal flies out into your throat hitting and tearing an artery, blood sprays as you panic for a few brief moments trying to stop the bleeding before you slump to the ground dead)

Mark down your characters death on the sheet and make a new character and give to the GM to introduce when appropriate.

Also there are optional rules that you can "turn on" before playing.

I'm currently arranging all the info onto a beer mat design, with optional rules as tick boxes so it can be printed and even be used as the "coin" to flip for resolution.

### some optional rules (if you're interested)

**luck** - everyone has a stack of extra coins at the start, and when you fail a SOD flip you can spend a coin to re-roll.

**shared luck** - there is a pile of shared luck on the table used as above.

**lucky git!** - when you roll a success first try (doesn't count if you used luck) you gain a luck token (for yourself or the shared pile).

**take me!** - when a player is about to flip, you can choose to flip, and if a dead is flipped its applies to you not them.

**I'll save you** - after a player has made a dead result, you can choose to try and save them, if you succeed you narrate how you saved them (they still failed their task) but if you die, you both die horribly.

**go on without me!** - when more than one person is facing a SOD, one person can choose to sacrifice themselves and everyone else automatically succeeds.

**skilled** - each player has a skill, when flipping with that skill, you can reflip once (as if you had 1 luck) every time that skill is relevant.
