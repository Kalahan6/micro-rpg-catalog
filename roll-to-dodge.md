# Roll to Dodge

The GM (Game Master) posts a situation the players are in. The players then post
their actions, according to the conditions GM sets. The GM then rolls for the
actions' results, and writes them out in his post. Then the players post actions
again, ad infinitum.

The action results are defined by a six-sided die roll:

[1]: Epic Fail. Your efforts only worsened your situation.  
[2]: Fail. Your skills or luck were insufficient.  
[3]: Meager success: The situation didn't improve by as much as you have intended.  
[4]: Success: Your efforts were sufficient to achieve your goal.  
[5]: Epic Success: Your skills and luck have combined to ensure your success.  
[6]: Overshot: Your efforts were more than required for the goal's completion, and your luck is such that unfortunate side-effects are inevitable.  

If at any time something threatens a player, that player may make a roll to
avoid the threat.

For each action, any number of rolls may be made, as determined by the GM.

Primary causes for multiple rolls include, but are not limited to:

* Actions explicitly composed of multiple actions
* Actions that imply other actions that are not declared free


For every dodge roll, any number of additional rolls may be made, as determined
by the circumstances, and any skills or special effects applied to the player.

Each successive dodge roll during a turn, unless it is a dodge against the same
object or character, will get a -1 bonus.

If you are Stunned, Dazed, or otherwise receive a temporary penalty to overall
or individual rolls, this penalty lasts until your next action is resolved, and
not through the whole turn.

If you receive a long-term effect that has the potential to alter itself, you
get an Effect Resistance roll immediately after your action is resolved to
determine the spread and consequences of the effect.

If you are Unconscious, whatever penalty you receive will not reduce your roll
score below 2, unless stated otherwise.

If you receive a mortal wound but are not killed outright, you need to pass a
roll to dodge Death at the end of every turn. Only bad rolls here will provide
penalties to survival rolls.

You can spend your turn to help another player achieve his goal. If your roll is
higher, it is taken as the success roll for the action.

You can also spend your turn to botch another player's action. If your roll is
higher, its opposite is taken as the success roll for the action.

In both cases, individual player rolls determine what happens to the players in
the course of the action.
