# Micro RPG catalog

A bunch of resources for micro-mini RPG systems.

> Most RPG systems published here don't mention any license or terms of use. I'm putting the here to gather them for archiving purposes, but you may take note that they're all (c) by their authors, unless mentioned otherwise.

## English

* [Roll for shoes](roll-for-shoes.md) a simplistic but revolutionary system. You roll for every action you need, even if it's know if you have your shoes on. Built for med-fan, but can be adapted to any settings.
* [Techno-Pyschic Samurai](techno-psychic-samurai.md) A cyberpunk thriller game. Players are street samurais with awesome mind powers in a corrupted city controlled by evil corporations.

## En français

* [Dé pour se chausser](dé-pour-se-chausser.md) French translation of "Roll for shoes", by yours, truly.
* [Keyword RPG](keyword-rpg.md), par Philippe Tromeur, alias Soner Du. “A l'époque du premier forum Casus à la fin des années 90, j'avais créé "keyword RPG" qui tenait dans le champ "keywords" d'un post de forum, qui faisait 80 caractères, je crois.”
