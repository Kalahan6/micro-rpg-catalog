# A quickie, by perpetuallytipsy

> My favourite quickie is stating that "The game ends with all the players in a warehouse pointing guns at each other" and then going to the first player "You wake up. Where are you?" Then just keep juggling, asking players for input a lot and just GMing, with all of you working together for the goal of getting to that last scene. No dice, GM's decision.
