# The 4 Coins Oracle

**CHARGEN**: Describe your character (including a source of trouble!)

**RULES**: Every time you want to do something risky, throw 4 coins

* **0 heads**:	You fail and things go worse!
* **1 head**:	You fail and you cannot try again
* **2 heads**:	You succeed if you are willing to pay a cost
* **3 heads**:	You succeed as intended
* **4 heads**:	You succeed with unexpected benefits!

Fix one or more coins to heads/tails before the throw if everyone agrees that you have some kind of advantage/disadvantage.
