# Techno-Psychic Samurai

A cyberpunk thriller game.

Players are street samurais with awesome mind powers in a corrupted city controlled by evil corporations.

Characters have three stats:

* Techno - use it for computer and technologic stuff
* Psychic - use it for mind stuff and to use your awesome mind powers
* Samurai - use it for all combat stuff

To create your character assign 5, 3 and 1 points to the three stats.

Whenever your character do something challenging or face a NPC, roll 1d6 and add the value of one stat. If the result is 7 or higher, the action is successful. Narrate what happens.

If you fail a combat action while facing a NPC, your character gets one wound. After 6 wounds, you character die.
