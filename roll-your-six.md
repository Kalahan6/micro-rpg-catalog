# Roll your 6

A system I've made up for quick, one shot, improvisational games I call Roll Your 6.

1) roll a d6 for your attributes. I use a base of three; strength, intelligence, and finesse. Finesse is basically equivalent to dnd charisma and dexterity, depending on the setting you are playing in. Roll finesse to smooth talk someone out of their secrets or to pop their head off with a pistol from across the room. Things like that.

Write down their scores, and from then on, anytime they roll, anything under what they rolled is a success, anything over is a failure.

If equal... Personally, I go by the mood of the game. Things like high fantasy or cyberpunk heists I go with equal as a success. Almost anything horror based I consider it a failure, up the challenge.

Simple, easy, deadly for combat.

2) play your game. Whatever setting. Fantasy, sci fi, modern, horror, whatever. The attributes I mad work pretty well across the board, just use common sense. And if you feel like somethings lacking, add away.

Like I said, I use it for quick, nothing games, but it also works very well for longer horror based games. I'm sure the whole thing isn't original, but I made up the whole thing on the spot one day for some friends, probably some other people who do something similar.

The whole system is designed to be as malleable as possible, and to work with whatever house rules we set from the get go. Like if I'm running an SCP foundation like game I'd set a health pool for their target, or in a typical fantasy setting everyone would get some sort of health pool. One one shot was a group of high school kids trying to survive a haunted mansion. Instant death if they were caught
