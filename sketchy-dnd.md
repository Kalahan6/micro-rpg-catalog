# Sketchy D&D

**Your hero:** Assign 3 points to STRength, DEXterity, CONstitution, WISdom, INTelligence and CHArisma (maximum 2), then choose a class below.

**Engine:** Rolls are 2d6+Stat vs target number: 6 to 10 as determined by the DM. (Hipsters like me can also use the \*World 6-/7-9/10+ framework) Roll STR or DEX to hit, INT or WIS for spells, CHA for reaction, WIS to notice, CON to resist poison, etc.

* In combat, you can attack STR times.
* Roll CON d6 for your hit points. 0 CON gives you 1hp.
* Your Armour Class is equal to 6+DEX+armour.
* If you can pay them, you can hire up to CHA followers.

**Thieves** can use DEX for thievery stuff, can use light weapons and armour.

**Fighters** get an extra hit die at level 1, 3, 5, etc. Heavy weapons and armour.

**Magic-users** can cast INT first level spells. At level 3 they get INT-1 second level spells, at level 5 INT-2 third-level spells, and so on. Puny weapons, no armour.

**Clerics** can turn undead with CHA. At level 2, they cast WIS first-level spells. At level 4 they get WIS-1 second-level spells, at level 6 WIS-2 third-level spells, and so on. Light weapons, medium armour.

**Elves** cast magic-user spells as if they were one level lower, and have super senses (INT to detect things). Medium weapons and armour.

**Dwarves** are fighters with +2 to resist alcohol, poison and magic. Medium armour and weapons.

**Weapons:** puny 1, light 1d6, medium 1d6+1, heavy (two-handed) 2d6.

**Armour:** light +1, medium +2, heavy +3, shield +1. No DEX bonus to AC with medium or heavy armour.

Spell lists adapted from B/X D&D.

Every 10xp, gain a level and add +1 to one stat.
